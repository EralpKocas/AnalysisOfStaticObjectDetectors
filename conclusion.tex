In this article, a detailed study of object detectors is introduced. Object detectors 
are used to detect object instances in given images. Detector features are important when 
a detector is designed since these features are the main factors of detectors' performance. 
These analyzed detectors can be used according to the application needed since they all have different 
advantages and disadvantages. Most commonly used datasets and performance metrics are introduced 
and the introduced detectors' performances are compared. The tradeoff between precision and 
recall is a design choice and it can be chosen based on the task required. For instance, you can lower the 
threshold if the task is dangerous and even though it is a false alarm, you want to get alarmed in any small 
change. On the other hand, if the cost of a false alarm is high and the task allows you to miss some events, 
then, using a high threshold to lower cost and miss some events is suitable. Based on these design choices, one 
can choose a detector that is most applicable to the needed application.
