In this article, a detailed study of object detectors is introduced. Object detectors 
are used to detect object instances in given images. Detector features are important when 
a detector is designed since these features are the main factors of detectors' performance. 
State-of-the-art detectors through the years 2015 to 2019 are introduced in this article. 
These detectors can be used according to the application needed since they all have different 
advantages and disadvantages. Most commonly used datasets and performance metrics are introduced 
and the introduced detectors' performances are compared. Based on this comparison, one can 
choose a detector that is most applicable to the needed application.
