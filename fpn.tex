Multi-scale handling is mentioned in section 2.3. For multi-scale input images, 
the required time and memory is too high to be trained end-to-end simultaneously. 
Also, pyramidal feature hiearchy in figure \ref{fig:multiscalefeatmaps1} is not 
effective for accurate object detection, specifically in small objects due to the 
resolution of feature maps. Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) is designed as a 
feature extractor keeping accuracy and speed in mind. \par 

As you can see in figure \ref{fig:fpnvis1}, FPN consists of a bottom-up and 
top-down pathway. In the bottom-up pathway, as in pyramidal feature hiearchy 
(Fig. \ref{fig:multiscalefeatmaps1}(c)), a convolutional network is used as 
feature extractor. As layers go through, the resoulution for feature maps 
are getting smaller, however, the detected features are more high level which 
leads to increase of semantic value for each layer. In the top-down pathway, 
higher resolution feature maps are constructed using semantic rich layer and 
corresponding layer from bottom-up pathway. The reason of lateral 
connection from bottom-up pathway is to obtain location information of 
objects since after bottom-up and top-down pathways, the locations of 
objects not precise. Thus, connection to corresponding feature maps 
may help to increase the possibility of finding correct locations for 
objects.
