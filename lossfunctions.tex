Loss functions are used to measure the difference between ground-truth 
values and the predicted values in machine learning problems. Loss 
functions can also be called error functions. In object detection problems, 
loss functions are composed of two parts: regression difference and classification 
difference. Loss functions are the measure of difference between predicted 
regression box and ground-truth regression box and also, the difference between the 
correct class for object and the predicted class for object. These functions 
can vary based on design choices and different loss functions have different 
advantages and disadvantages. The most frequent used loss functions as 
following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item L1 Loss
    \item L2 Loss
    \item Smooth L1 Loss
    \item Cross-Entropy Loss
\end{itemize}
