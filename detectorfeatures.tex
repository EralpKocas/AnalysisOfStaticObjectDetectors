As mentioned in the Motivation section, in this article, the aim is to analyze 
object detectors based on various detector features. In the following five 
subsections, the following features will be examined:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Backbone Networks
    \item Scanning Methods
    \item Multi-scale Handling
    \item Loss Functions
\end{itemize} 
\indent 

These listed features are the essential features for detectors. When one 
studies the object detectors, one can see that major increases in the 
performances of object detectors are caused by changes in these features. 
These features will be analyzed and shown in the following subsections of 
this section.
