Object detection is a concept of computer vision in which trained models 
detect objects with their category and location in given images or videos. 
As you can see in figure \ref{fig:bicycle1}, object detection is both 
classifying and localizing the object instances in given images. Also, the 
parts of the given image that contain no object is called background.
