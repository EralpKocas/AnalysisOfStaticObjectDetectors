Object detection is a concept of computer vision in which trained models 
detect objects with their category and location in given images or videos. 
As you can see in figure \ref{fig:objdet1}, object detection is both 
classifying and localizing the object instances in given images. Also, the 
parts of the given image that contain no object is called background.

    objects. Also, the predicted class and the prediction confidence scores are 
    indicated in the upper parts of bounding boxes.}
