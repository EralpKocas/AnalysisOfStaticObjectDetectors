Obtained accuracy and frame rate per second performances of detectors are visible 
in table \ref{table:2}. These results are valid on COCO dataset. 
Since most of the detectors perform well on Pascal VOC dataset and COCO is the more hard 
dataset to obtain better accuracy, only the results on COCO dataset are shown. Also, 
the aim of this study is to find out which detectors can be applied in real-time. 
Therefore, the detectors that are shown in table \ref{table:2} 
are chosen in a specific form in which they are most close to their real-time 
applicable specifications. \par

Based on the results in table \ref{table:2}, YOLOv2, YOLOv3 for 320x
320 image resolution, YOLOv3 for 416x416 image resolution, SSD for both 300x300 and 
512x512 image resolution, EfficientDet-D3 can be used in real-time applications since 
videos require 24 FPS to play without any distortion in human perception. Although 
the rest of the detectors cannot be applicable in real-time, their accuracy is better 
than these real-time applicable detectors. Thus, these detectors can be used in 
different cases than real-time applications, so that, better accuracy in objective 
can be obtained.
