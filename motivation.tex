Various models are developed through years in the field of object detection. 
All these models are developed using different methods. Although all of these
models are based on convolutional neural networks, their way of identifying objects
in given images or frames are varies. Also, their backbone networks, scanning methods, 
multi-scale object detection, error functions are varies. These varieties affect the 
performance of models in different aspects such as small and large object detections,
speed of the model, etc. \par

The aim in this article is to investigate, analyze, and compare the performances of
various state-of-the-art object detectors through the time trained on video data. Then, 
promising detectors will be selected and these selected detectors will be analyzed on
Video Object Detection dataset on both mean average precision and frame rate per second 
basis.
