In this section, state-of-the-art object detectors will be examined. 
The following detectors are the best-performing detectors in their 
publication time. These detectors are divided into two subsection that 
are two-stage detectors and one-stage detectors. The difference between 
these one-stage and two-stage detectors is their way to process given 
frame to detect objects. \par 

In two-stage detectors, detections process takes two stages that are 
region proposal and object detection. In first phase, model generates 
region of interest that are the regions in which objects can be found 
most likely. Then, in second phase, a classifier processes these regions 
to detect objects. \par

In one-stage detectors, detection process takes only one stage. 
Detector runs over a dense sampling of possible locations in given frame. 
This approach converges faster but its performance might be worse than 
two-stage detectors.
