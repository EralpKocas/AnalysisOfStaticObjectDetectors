In this section, state-of-the-art object detectors will be examined. 
The following detectors are the best-performing detectors in their 
publication time. These detectors are divided into two subsections that 
are two-stage detectors and one-stage detectors. The difference between 
these one-stage and two-stage detectors is their way to process a given 
frame to detect objects. \par 

In two-stage detectors, the detections process takes two stages that are 
region proposal and object detection. In the first phase, the detector generates 
a region of interest that are the regions in which objects can be found 
most likely. Then, in the second phase, a classifier processes these regions 
to detect objects. \par

In one-stage detectors, the detection process takes only one stage. 
The detector runs over a dense sampling of possible locations in the given frame. 
This approach converges faster but its performance might be worse than 
two-stage detectors.
