Static object detection refers to object detection in a single image.
In this context, object detectors do not use temporal information about
objects in given image or frame sequences. Each given images are considered
separately. The aim of investigating static object detection is to make a 
generalization from single frame to multiple frames. Understanding the pros 
and cons of each object detector in various static object detection cases 
are important to generalize and create a baseline for video object detection 
which requires more features to be considered for a well-performing detector. \par
