Backbone networks are the initial part of a detector's architecture.
The given image is processed for the first time in backbone networks.
These backbone networks are implemented as Fully Convolutional Neural
Networks. Since these backbone networks are full convolutional neural networks, 
one of the main benefits of using these is to train our detectors end-to-end. 
The used networks are the ones that are already proven to perform 
classification well in large image datasets. The most used backbone networks 
are VGG \cite{vggcite}, ResNet \cite{resnetcite}, DarkNet \cite{darknetcite}, 
and Hourglass \cite{hourglasscite} networks.

The main function of these networks is to compute feature maps over the given 
images, so that, these extracted feature maps are used to detect and localize 
objects in given images.
