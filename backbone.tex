Backbone networks are the initial part of a detector's architecture.
The given frame is processed for the first time in backbone networks.
These backbone networks are implemented as Fully Convolutional Neural
Networks. The used networks are the ones that are already proven to be 
perform well in images. The most used backbone networks are 
VGG, ResNet, DarkNet, and Hourglass networks.
\indent

The main function of these networks is to compute convolutional feature map
over given frame, so that, these extracted feature maps are used to detect 
and localize objects in given frames.
