Before introducing YOLO9000, one has to explain YOLOv2 since YOLOv2 
is the improved version of YOLO in both detection performance and speed 
while keeping real-time speed of detection. YOLO9000 refers to a joint 
training method on object detection and classification. Using this 
joint training method, one can detect objects that do not have any 
labelled detection data. Now, YOLOv2 will be explained and later, 
YOLO9000 will be explained. \par

As the name of the article suggested, YOLOv2 will be explained in three 
different perspective: Better, faster, stronger. While better and faster 
refer to performance increase of YOLO which is YOLOv2, stronger refers to 
YOLO9000. 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Better
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Analyzing the sufferings of YOLO, one can see that 
YOLO suffers from localization and having a low recall rate. Thus, 
the aim is to improve recall and localization while maintaining 
classification accuracy.
    \end{itemize}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Batch Normalization
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Applying batch normalization leads to significant 
improvement in performance and also it reduces the need for other forms 
of regularizations. One can remove dropout from the model without overfitting.
            \item Batch normalization leads to 2\% increase in mAP.
        \end{itemize}
        \item High Resolution Classifier
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Training of YOLO is occured in two phases: first, convolutional 
layers are trained on ImageNet classification task on image resolution of 224 x 224.
Then, the convolutional layers are trained for detection on image resolution of 448 x 448.
This causes detector to switch itself for learning detection for new resolution 
simultaneously.
            \item In YOLOv2, before detector is switched for learning detection, 
classifier network is trained for 448 x 448 resolution images for 10 epochs on ImageNet.
Thus, a time is provided for network to adjust itself to work better on high resolution.
            \item High Resolution Classifier leads to 4\% increase in mAP.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Convolutional with Anchor Boxes
        \begin{itemize}
            \item xd
        \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Faster
\end{enumerate}
